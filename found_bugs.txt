1. Need to add possibility to make window smaller.
   Now app is crashing because can't add things at the screen, so
   I should use try-except and calculate variables again.
    
2. Terminal-size change provides resizing curses windows, but sometimes
   lagging and don't work really propertly. Maybe it will work better later.

3. Need to add settings save.

4. Need to repair auto exiting from preview file mode.
