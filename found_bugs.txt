1. Need to give warning while opening dir/file with no permissions.
    #try-except probably will be used to solve this.

2. No menu position limitation.
    #easy to do, just didn't need to earlier.

3. If list of files is too long, app crashes.
    #need to add some kind of scroll-bar, but it will take a moment.
    
4. No curses windows scalling after terminal-size change.
    #gonna create function checking if size was changed or not.
